# Big Data Architecture Course
## Institute of Technology of Cambodia

Welcome to the Big Data Architecture course repository. This course is taught by myself and is tailored for Master's students in Data Science at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia. The curriculum is inspired by two notable university courses:
1. [CSE2520: Big Data Processing, 2023](https://burcuku.github.io/cse2520-bigdata/)
2. [Big Data Analytics, CSE545 - Spring 2023](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/CSE545/Slides/)

### Course Description

This course aims to provide students with comprehensive insights into the architectures and processing techniques essential for big data analysis. It covers theoretical foundations, practical data processing skills, and the application of big data technologies in real-world scenarios.

### Modules and Projects

- **Big Data Paper**: A deep dive into contemporary research and methodologies in big data.
- **Big Data Processing**: Hands-on sessions on processing large datasets effectively.
- **Data Analysis with Map Reduce**: Implementing MapReduce models for efficient data processing.
- **Final Project Proposal**: Students propose their capstone projects based on real-world data challenges.
- **Final Project**: Execution of the capstone project, applying big data solutions to solve practical problems.

### Acknowledgements

This course draws inspiration from esteemed faculty and resources from global institutions. Special thanks to the contributors of the CSE2520 and CSE545 courses for their foundational materials and insights.
