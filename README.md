This course is offered by me to teach master's students in Data Science at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia. The course is inspired by two main sources from other universities, including:
1.CSE2520: Big Data Processing, 2023 [https://burcuku.github.io/cse2520-bigdata/]
2.Big Data Analytics, CSE545 - Spring 2023 [https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/CSE545/Slides/]
