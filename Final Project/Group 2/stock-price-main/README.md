Stock Price Prediction with BigData
1. Introduction 
This project aims to create a specialized Big Data Processing and Analysis Framework tailored for Stock Price Prediction. By leveraging specific tools and technologies, the framework will encompass data ingestion, storage, and advanced analytics, ultimately predicting stock prices for the next day.
2. Framework Development
Components: 
Data Collection: 
We developed Python scripts for data scraping to collect historical stock data from the CSX website from 01/01/2019-10/11/2023.
Data Storage: 
Utilize Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for efficient storage of historical stock data. 
Data Processing and Analytics: 
Leverage Spark for distributed in-memory data processing. 
Design and implement data analytics pipelines for feature extraction and exploration. 
Machine Learning: 
Apply SVM algorithm from MLlib for stock price prediction. 
Train the model using historical stock data.
